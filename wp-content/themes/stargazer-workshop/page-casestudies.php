                        The company CEO wanted a modern looking landing page to help him explain what the application is about and
                            start collecting leads with a form where visitors can sign up for the demo of the app.

                        Robert, the company CEO got in touch with me after searching for a single person to both develop and design him
                            a landing page. We got in touch on skype and after a nice chat he sent me over the pdf abstract document he has
                            put together. It was a complex document that I had to simplify and turn into a website presentation that is 
                            user friendly. I than began desining the page following my standard
                            <a href="process.html" target="_blank">workflow process</a> and sent him over the image files of the initial
                            design. We iterated a few times and eventually created a design that we both liked. I then started coding by
                                forking a bootstrap template with pre built gulpjs configuration and scss partials for efficient development.
                                I coded the static page and then turned it into a Wordpress theme, utilizing the Custom Field plugin to 
                                allow Robert to change all the content on the page: images that were in the sliders, text in every section
                                and social urls. Robert and I moved into another project after this one, design and development of his 
                                personal analytics services company.

                        Justo team sent me over their website to draw design inspiration from and sent me over a wireframe of the landing page they desired. The landing page had a savings calculator that would allow visitors to preview how much they would save by buying or selling a property with Justo. I developed a <a href="http://www.justopromo.ca/promo/" target="_blank">calculator</a> by hand using jQuery and designed a page that would capture their leads and easily allow its visitors to get in touch with a contact person from Justo team.

I followed the element positioning and layout with a special focus on making the page properly architecture on mobile (wireframes were desktop only) because most of Seniorly prefer mobile. After few iterations where I tried to match their existing design system we came up with something we both liked.
